Paddle provides two options of payment

(1) Subscription plans with event name subscription_created
(2) Regular payment that is not a subscription with event name 

Note:
Cashier paddle does not manage the regular payment option.
It does not saved entry to the paddle_subscription database table simply 
because it is not a subscription.

Basically, it is a one time off payment.

Thus it has to be manually registered and handled when offered and saved 
just like launch one time payments (jvzoo, warrior e.t.c)

The data from this payment is saved in the one_off_payment_logs database table
