For paddle to work, ensure that

1. CASHIER_PATH=paddle is set in the .env

2. On paddle event page, ensure webhook is set with endpoint paddle/webhook.
You can set it up here https://vendors.paddle.com/alerts-webhooks

3. When creating a subscription plan here https://vendors.paddle.com/subscriptions/plans,
since paddle does not provide a grouping option for plans created to be tagged or categorized,
ensure to use the format APPNAME_PLANNAME.

With the app name, one can figure out the plans that belongs to a particular app using api

4. Paddle only supports 5 endpoints, thus the primary endpoint is 
basically setup to repost the webhooks coming from paddle to the list of registered app endpoints
